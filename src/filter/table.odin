/*
The names a Set holds: an open-addressed hash table over one byte blob.

Each name is written once into `blob` as its flags byte, the name, and a NUL,
which `rule_key` never lets into a name. A slot holds the name's 32-bit hash and
the offset of its entry, so a probe compares hashes in the slot array and reads
the blob only on a match: a lookup is one hash and a short linear scan. A rule
costs its name, two bytes, and an 8-byte slot at up to 80% load.

Nothing is deleted: a name a `$badfilter` takes back keeps its entry with no
flags, which reads as absent, so there are no tombstones. Both arrays are on the
heap rather than the Set's arena, so a growth frees what it replaces, and
`table_trim` cuts the slots to the final count once a load is done.
