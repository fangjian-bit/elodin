/*
An upstream `timeout` under a millisecond or over a day is refused, at the top
level and on a route (#499).

It is what every exchange with one server is given, and a query's budget is two
of them, so zero is not "wait as long as it takes": the query has run out before
it starts, a dial gets a one-millisecond connect window, and every query answers
SERVFAIL. A millisecond is the smallest wait the sockets and `poll` underneath
can express, so anything shorter reads as zero there too. Past a day the far end
is the same failure: the dial's millisecond count wraps past about 596h, and two
of a timeout past about 1.28 million hours overflow into a spent budget.
